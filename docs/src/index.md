# PartiallySeparableNLPModels: a NLPModel exploiting automatically its partially-separable structure (to define partitioned quasi-Newton models)

## How to cite
If you use PartiallySeparableNLPModels.jl in your work, please cite using the format given in [CITATION.bib](CITATION.bib).

## Philosophy
The purpose of PartiallySeparableNLPModels.jl is to define automatically partially-separable [NLPModels](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/NLPModels.jl).
Moreover, it defines several partitioned quasi-Newton models which are meant to be minimized through solvers from [JSOSolvers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/JSOSolvers.jl)

## Compatibility
Julia â‰¥ 1.6.

## How to install
```
pkg> add PartiallySeparableNLPModels
pkg> test PartiallySeparableNLPModels
```

## How to use 
See the [tutorial](https://JuliaSmoothOptimizers.github.io/PartiallySeparableNLPModels.jl/main/tutorial/).

## Dependencies
The module uses [ExpressionTreeForge.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/ExpressionTreeForge.jl) to detect the partially-separable structure, [PartitionedStructures.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/PartitionedStructures.jl) to allocate partitioned quasi-Newton approximations and [PartitionedVectors.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers/PartitionedVectors.jl) to fit the `AbstractVector` interface mandatory for AbstractNLPModel methods.
